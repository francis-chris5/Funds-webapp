I think everything could be transmitted in csv form
    * all goes into tables except balance sheet, and that's a list of accounts in each category/subcategory
    * this would minimize transmission quantity and can just be .split("\n") and .split(",") in the javascript to have an array
    * I think encryption/decryption would be fairly easy this way too

    Counterpoints:
        - json could be better setup to add appropriate html based on object received
        - xml could just be included in the stylesheet directly
        - server sending html string then to .innerHtml would probably be the easiest client-side (server handles all processing maybe easier to save, no need to send back more than a boolean... ++autosave)






All new accounts should start with cash, revenue, and expense accounts
    * should probably block abilitity to delete revenue and expense account or give a warning message cash flows tool won't work
        * if html is modularized instead of pages could only load that if there is an account called "revenue" and an account called "expense"
