/**
 * An Transaction is the basic building block of the whole thing, it is a collection of datafields representing a single real-world monetary transaction.
 * Every Transaction made will have a corresponding Transfer -another entry with debits and credits reversed for the GAAP standard double-entry method of "balancing the books."
 * The early stages of the plan have the Transaction object corresponding to a single record in a relational database for compatibility with other accounting software concerns.

     * @param reconcile Traditionally this column was marked after the fact once a check had cleared the bank, I don't think this applies much in the modern world, but there's still plenty of ways a particular user could use a boolean value to mark or not in the transaction (personally I check this for expenses that may be reimbursed and unchecked for regular expenses, among other things)

     * @param credit The right column of the ledger: liabilities, revenue, and most equity are normal (increase with) credit accounts
